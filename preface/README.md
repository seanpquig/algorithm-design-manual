- *The Catalog of Algorithmic Problems*
	- 75 most important problems arising in practice

- War Stories
 	- In practice, algoritms do not arise at beginning of a large project.  They typically arise as subproblems when inital solution becomes inadequate.
 	- War stories are experiences with real-life problems.
